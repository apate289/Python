15. Race Conditions: More Fun Than a Squirrel on Caffeine
Question:
What is a race condition, and how do you detect it in a Python program?

Answer:
Explanation:
A race condition is when threads try to outdo each other, and things go haywire.
 Itâ€™s like racing to the fridge during a commercial break. Use locks or careful planning 
 to avoid them, but detecting them usually means running into weird, hard-to-reproduce 
 bugs.
