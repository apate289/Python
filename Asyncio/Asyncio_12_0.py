Deadlocks: Stuck in a Rut
Question:
What is a deadlock, and how can you avoid it before it ruins your day?

Answer:
Explanation:
    A deadlock happens when two (or more) threads are stuck waiting on each other 
    to release a resource. Itâ€™s like two people holding doors open for each other,
    neither one willing to go first. 
    Avoid it by planning your locks carefully or using a timeout to bail out.
