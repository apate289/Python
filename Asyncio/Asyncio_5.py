# Asyncio + HTTP Requests = ???
# How do you handle multiple HTTP requests asynchronously using asyncio and aiohttp? 
# Because who needs simplicity?
"""
Explanation:
aiohttp is what you use when you want to make your life harder by doing HTTP requests asynchronously. 
The example above? Yeah, it works...most of the time.
