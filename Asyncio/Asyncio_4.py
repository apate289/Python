# GIL: The Global Annoyance Lock
# What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, 
# and why does it make threading kind of pointless?
"""
Explanation:
So, the GIL is like this annoying roommate who doesn’t let anyone else 
use the microwave while they’re using it. It means that even though you have threads, 
only one can run at a time. CPU-bound tasks? Forget about it.
